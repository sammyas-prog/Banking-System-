TechPro A1 Prototype Banking System

The code was created to combine Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
concepts with GUI programming and to demonstrate how a simple banking 
application works in real life.

Specifically, the purpose of the code is to help developers and students 
understand how OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism,
and constructors are applied in an actual software project. These concepts make 
the program more organized, secure, reusable, and easier to maintain. For example, 
bank accounts, users, and transactions are represented as objects, just like in a 
real banking system.

In addition, the code uses Java GUI frameworks such as Swing and AWT to create a 
user-friendly interface. Instead of interacting through the console, users can 
click buttons, enter information, and view results through windows, labels, and 
forms. This makes the application more realistic and easier to use, similar to 
real-world banking software.

The program also simulates basic banking operations such as user login, account 
creation, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing transaction history. 
By doing this, it shows how software can manage data, handle user actions, and 
update information correctly.
